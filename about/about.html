  							  <p>Hello, I'm Victoria
  							  Castor, a Mexican scientific living in Europe.
                  I wrote this web section to share something about me, from a short autobiography
                  to a list of func facts about me.
                  </p>

                  <p>In my
                  <a href="" target="_blank">blog </a> I wrote more about particular topics
  							  that I found interesting, hoping someone else would also find
  							  useful, topics from,
                  <a href="../music/music.html" target="_blank">music </a> and
                  <a href="../more/vegetarian.html" target="_blank">vegetarien recipes</a>
                  to scientic papers.</p>

								<h2>Autobiography</h2>


						    <p>Throughout my life I've been intrested in science. As a kid one of my first
						    hobbies in was astronomy, making me think about planets, stars and the laws
					  	  that govern the Universe. Growing up, my passion of astronomy extended to other
				  		  natural sciences, trying to find an explanation for every phenomena arround me.
			  			  Continuing my childhood without too much fiends, I started to play music,
		  				  making myself happy and with one propuse for life. Latter on, during my high school
	  					  years my favourite classes were history, philosophy and ethics. Thinking that
  						  my life would be dedicade for the arts and humanities.</p>

								<p>However, when I had to decide about my career I
								listened my inner childhood and I chose chemistry as my bachelor
								degree. I started without particular preference in specific chemistry branch.
                I tried to learn from analytical chemistry to synthesis as equal.
                Nevertheless, it was not until I take a curse of quantum chemistry and
                saw scientific dissemination about Quantum Mechanics my mind change the
								paradigm of my scientific thinking. I understood the deep realtionship between
								chemistry and physics, how so many problems in chemistry are rooted in
								the physical properties of systems, and how so many physics of the complex
								is better explained using concepts borrowed from other sciences.
                </p>

                <p>Looking for more about physics I understood that I like physics tons of times
                more than chemistry, even if I like chemistry, 
                trying to understand the basis of everything for me was a new way of seeing the world.
                Moreover,
								understanding that all the math I had knewn wasn't enough at all to
								understand the whole complex world of basic science.</p>


								<!--<p>From my
								point of view, the physical chemistry, is a blurred and diffuse
								border between both sience and made me want to learn more about quantum
								chemistry. That was the reason that I joined the research group of
								<a href="../research/TomasGroup.html">Dr. Tomás Rocha Rinza</a>
								in my bachelor last year. Under his supervision I worked in the
								study of the hydrogen bond, using techniques of simulation of computational
								chemistry.</p>-->

								<p>Later on, I started my MSc Degree in 2020 becuase of that I moved from America to
								Europe, from Mexico City to Madrid, particularly. That time wasn't the best time to travel,
								since the COVID-19 quarentine started in that year. Not knowing much about Madrid,
								my life in Europe was emocionally intense, however, with the time all
								was growing to better. I got the vaccine in Madrid, fortunatly, thus I
								could travel again.</p>

								<p>After one and a half year in Spain I moved to Paris to write my master thesis
								at Sorbonne Université, while I was in Paris I had one of the best part in my whole life,
                knowing more about
								me and also loving the city.</p>
