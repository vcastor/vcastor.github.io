								<p>Hi! I'm
								VCastor, a mexican scientific living in Spain. In this website you will find a
								variety of topics that I found intresting for me, hopping someone will find it
								useful. The topics has a variety, <a href="music.html">
								music </a> or <a
								href="vegetarian.html">vegetarien recipes</a> to scientic
								papers.</p>

								<h2>Autobiography</h2>
								<p>Throughout my life I've been intrested in science. As a kind one of my first
								hobbies in was astronomy, making me think about planets, stars ande the laws
								that govern the Universe. Growing up, my passion of astronomy extended to other
								natural sciences, trying to find an explanation for phenomena arround me.
								Continuing with my childhood without too much fiends, I started to play music,
								makes me happy and with one propuse for life. Latter on, during my high school
								years my favourite classes were history, philosophy and ethics. Thinking that
								my life will be dedicade for the arts and humanities.</p>

								<p>However, I
								decided to listen my inner childhood and I chose chemistry as my bachelor
								degree. I understand that my life will be by and for the science since I saw
								the classes of my bachelor. Starting without particular preference in specific
								branch of chemistry. I tried to learn from analytical chemistry to synthesis as
								equal. Nevertheless, it was not until I take a curse of quantum chemistry and
								saw scientific dissemination about quantum mechanics my mind change the
								paradigm of my scientific thinking. I understood the deep realtionship between
								chemistry and physics, how so many problems in chemistry have an its root in
								the physical properties of the systems, and how so many physics of the complex
								is better explained using concepts borrowed from others sciences. And how all
								the maths that I knew wasn't enought to understand all of the work.</p>

								<p>From my
								point of view, of the physical chemistry, this blurred even more the diffuse
								border between both sience and made me want to learn more about quantum
								chemistry. That was the reason that I joined the research group of Dr. Tom√°s
								Rocha Rinza in my bachelor last year. Under his supervision I worked in the
								study of the hydrogen bond, using techniques of simulation of computational
								chemistry.</p>

								<p>In 2020 I
								started my master science degree, moving to Spain, in not the best time for the
								world, because the COVID-19 quarentine started in this year. Currently I'm
								confined, but I know the best way to fight with the virus is staying home. </p>

								<p>Not knowig
								where I will do
								my Master
								Thesis, isn't
								certanty either
								if will be in
								Europe for how
								many time, also
								if someday I
								will come back
								to America.</p>
